Can add 
	speed changer
	bounce / no-bounce toggle!
	Leave a trail or not
	Split ( disapper after some splits(pop out!) )

	OR 
	Add a user controlled evil circle, that can eat up the given circle 
	For each circle eaten you increase in size! But your size decreases as time increases!
	There is a meter indicating your size ( there is a max size limit also (100%), ), 
	if it becomes zero , you disappear , all the balls (become happy! random fast , vibratory, motion )
	You only win , if you eat all the balls before disappearing!

	Levels can also be introduced to this.

ISSUES
Balls get stuck travelling parallely at edge, cant eat them
The evil circle leaves a trail , not desirable!
